## Roadmap

During this phase I underwent four stages in order to have a clear grasp and understanding of the project. Stage 1: Familiarizing myself with the company. Stage 2: Competitor Analysis Stage 3: Branding Analysis Stage 4: Ux Overall Questions. The final outcome of the process was a comprehensive and clear understanding of the company and the audience of the project. 

In this phase, I analyzed the entire design using a bird's-eye view in order to better understand the pattern of components as well as typography, colors, and other crucial information to gain a thorough view of the project prior to begin with the write code. In this phase, I gather all images, text, icons and other resources to help the project succeed. 

During this phase, I used modern, semantic and accessible HTML5 combined with Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS made it quicker to write and maintain the code for my project. By using this utility-first framework, I did not have to write custom CSS to style my website. Instead, I used utility classes to control the padding, margin, color, font, shadow, and more of my project.
